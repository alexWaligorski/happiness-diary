This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), typescript and Material UI.

## Happiness Diary

This is an App based on the principles of positive psychology and the everyday practice of gratefulness.
By filling the diary with happy thoughts, selfless actions and positive micro habits your mindset will change gradually and start focussing on the things that really matter: kind people, joyful memories and cheerful moments!

## Happy Coding

This project is also one of my steps towards learning more about web development and mastering typescript and Material UI.

## Getting Started

To run locally, run the development server and install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Now you should be able to run it on your own device.
